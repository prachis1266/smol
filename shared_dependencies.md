The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. "next": This is the main dependency for all the files as they are all part of a Next.js application. It provides the core functionalities such as server-side rendering and routing.

2. "react" and "react-dom": These are used across all the files for building the user interface of the application.

3. "typescript": This is used in all the .tsx files for type checking and improved developer experience.

4. "_app": This is a special Next.js component that is shared across all pages. It is used to initialize pages and is imported in the _app.tsx file.

5. "_document": This is another special Next.js component that is shared across all pages. It is used to augment the application's <html> and <body> tags and is imported in the _document.tsx file.

6. "globals.css": This is the global stylesheet that is imported in the _app.tsx file and is shared across all pages.

7. "favicon.ico" and "vercel.svg": These are static files that are shared across all pages and are located in the public directory.

8. "Component", "pageProps": These are exported from _app.tsx and are used in all pages for rendering the components and passing the page props.

9. "Html", "Head", "Main", "NextScript": These are exported from _document.tsx and are used in all pages for rendering the HTML structure of the application.

10. "getInitialProps": This is a Next.js function that is used in _document.tsx for server-side rendering.

Please note that the actual shared dependencies might vary based on the specific requirements of the application.
